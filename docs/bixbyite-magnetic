## **RMC refinement**

There are four main steps to performing a reverse Monte Carlo refinement:
1. Define a supercell
2. Load and preprocess a diffuse scattering intensity dataset
3. Setup and perform a refinement
4. Calculate and visualize the correlations

### **Crystal tab**

To define a supercell, it is first necessary to construct a unit cell from the average structure.

1. Begin by loading a crystallographic information file (CIF) or magnetic CIF file
  - The button is located on the upper left corner of window *Load CIF*.
  - The parameters are extracted from the CIF file and populated into two tables.
    - The left hand table displays all atoms in the unit supercell.
    - The right hand table gives the basic atom site information.
        - Modifying the atom site information on the right automatically updates the unit cell table on the right.
2. Modify (if necessary) the atom site table
  - Begin by choosing between *Neutron* and *X-ray* refinement in the upper right combo box.
     - By selecting refinement type first, the relevant parameters are available to edit including nuclei and ions.
        - For magnetic refinement, *Neutron* must be selected to access magnetic information.
     - To display, different parameters, choose from *Site parameters*, *Structural parameters*, and if available *Magnetic parameters*.
        - In *Site parameters*, along with the atom (isotope for neutron, ion for X-ray), its occupancy and fractional coordinates $$u$$, $$v$$, $$w$$ can be modified.
          An atom may also be de-activated or activated for refinement.
        - In *Structural parameters*, the anisotropic displacement parameters $$U_{ij}$$ may be modified.
          The equivalent isotropic parameter $$U_\text{iso}$$ and its principal components will be updated ($$U_1$$, $$U_2$$, $$U_3$$).
          If available, *Magnetic parameters* allows the magnetic ion to be chosen along with the magnetic moment component along the crystal axes.
          If a valid  `.mcif` is used, the magnetic symmetry will be accounted for. The $$g$$-factor can also be specified.
     - Select *Magnetic parameters*, choose $$\mathrm{Fe3+}$$ and $$\mathrm{Mn3+}$$ ions and deactivate site 3 since oxygen is nonmagnetic.
     - Create a supercell with size $$N_1=4$$, $$N_2=4$$, and $$N_3=4$$ by entering the number of cells along each crystal axes.
3. Optionally save the CIF file of the supercell and visualize it in external program [VESTA](https://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/)

**Hints**
- The size of the supercell defines the maximum resolution of the refined reciprocal space pattern
  - A larger supercell is needed to refine finer reciprocal space features.
    - Along each dimension $$i$$, the resolution in reciprocal lattice units is $$1/N_i$$.
  - Start with a small number (e.g. $$4\times4\times4$$) and increase as needed.
    - Too large of a supercell uses more memory and takes longer to refine.

### **Intensity tab**

Once a supercell is defined, the experimental data can be loaded and preprocessed for refinement
