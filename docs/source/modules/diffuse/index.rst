The `diffuse` module contains many of the general functions that are utilized in the calculation of diffuse scattering patterns.
These include the modules for individual contributions of disorder among magnetic moments, site occupancies, and atomic displacements:

* `magnetic`
* `occupational`
* `displacive`

In addition, the `nonmagnetic` module contains convenience functions for general structural-type disorder.
